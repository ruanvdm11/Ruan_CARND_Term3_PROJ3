## System Integration Project

This project required the integration of all the major systems of a self-driving vehicle with the use of ROS.

The vehicle must be able to:
* Follow waypoints
* Control the throttle and brake
* Detect Traffic lights
* Determine the status of the Traffic lights (ie. Red, Yellow, or Green)
* Plan the route in the simulation environment to adhere to Traffic Lights

Below is a short video giving an indication of what the vehicle does.
